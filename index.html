							<h3>Mobas</h3>
							<p class="featuretext">Moba stands for multiplayer online battle arena. LoL, DOTA and Smite are prime examples of MOBAs. In MOBAs the common objective is to push the three lanes, destroy the turrets leading up to the nexus and destroy it. Click <a href="#mobas">here</a> to read more about MOBAs</p>

							<h3>Why LoL is Unique</h3>
							<p class="featuretext">LoL is unique because it has more than one game mode. For example, the standard gamemode (found in <strong>all</strong> MOBAs) is the 5v5 in the three laned map (in LoL called Summoners Rift). LoL's other gamemodes include ARAM, Twisted Treeline and Dominion. Click <a href="#themaps">here</a> to read about the maps.</p>

							<h3>Playing the Game</h3>

							<h3>MOBAs</h3>

						<p>MOBAs are commonly top down views on the character you are playing, though, Smite is an example of a MOBA in a 3rd person view.</p>

							<h3>The Maps</h3>
						</header>
						</p>Summoners Rift is found in nearly all MOBAs, although it may be called another name, it is still the same map. Howling Abyss is a map that in LoL is a part of a gamemode called ARAM (All Random All Mid). It is made of one lane only, with five players each team. PvP is what ARAM was made for. A similar map can also be found in Smite. Twisted Treeline is a 3v3 map with two lanes. It was made to be a shorter version of Summoners Rift. The Crystal Scar is part of a gamemode called Dominion, where the players ojective is to take and keep control of the towers. There are five towers located in the map (it is circle shaped). Again, it is a 5v5 gamemode.</p>

							<h3>Playing The Game</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Players use their four abilities to damage or kill enemies. There are three different types of abilities, the active, the passive and the toggle. An active abilitie is an abilitie you have to manually use, the passive is an abilitie that does what it does automatically. Lastly the toggle is an abilitie that when you use, activates it's passive, and when used again, turns off it's passive. Then there are three lanes. The top, mid and bot. In most games you have 1 player top, 1 player mid, 1 player as jungler, and 2 players bot. The bot players are the adc and support, and the jungler kills neutral monsters in the jungle to lvl. The objective of the jungler is to stay anonymous, and when he decides the time is right, can gang up with their teamates or <strong>gank</strong> the enemies to secure the kill. There are two jungles, one for each team on their side of the map. sometimes the jungler may decide to <strong>invade</strong> which is when they go into the enemies jungle and kill their monsters</p>
